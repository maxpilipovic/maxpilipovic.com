# A Year in Review, My 2024

---

### I GRADUATED

This year, I proudly graduated from **Eastern Illinois University** with a **Bachelor of Computer Science**, along with minors in Mathematics and Business Administration. My time as a student was incredibleâ€”I played Division 1 Tennis for five years, served as the president of my fraternity in my final year, and started dating the love of my life in January 2024 (nearly one year!). Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for the people I met along the way and the challenges that came my way. And of course, the fun at college, maybe a bit too much... But hey, that's me, always down for a good time.

If you had asked me about getting involved around on-campus, I probably would laughed. However, College taught me how to come out of my shell, make friends, and network. Man... Before college, I sat at a computer 24/7 and only went outside to play tennis. Guess things have changed now...

Reflecting on all these experiences, I am sad but excited to be moving on from Eastern Illinoisâ€”a chapter of my life I will never forget and will always hold in my heart. However, as they all say, one door closes and another one opens. Cheers to that ðŸ¥‚

### The Path Ahead ðŸš€

My passion for creating things has only grown stronger. Since moving, I have focused much more on my career, trying to learn and grow as a **software engineer**.

Finally, looking at the path ahead: 2025, geez. I turn 24 this year, that feels old... Regardless, I am dedicating this year to career growth. Learning as much as possible, posting videos of my journey, and documenting my progress here.

Iâ€™m looking forward to studying more, serving as a teaching assistant at the university, updating this website frequently (hopefully), and adding new features. Also, I'm working on enhancing my technical skills on my social media platforms, and continuing living life! Cheers to 2025 ðŸ¥‚
